"""Cross-library comparison: match timing arcs, align their grids, diff the values.

Comparing a generated Liberty against a reference one is a normal part of a PDK
flow. Doing it by hand means writing, for every pair of cells, an arc matcher,
a grid intersector, an axis-role normalizer and a differ — and the last two
fail silently: a table whose axes are swapped produces plausible but wrong
deltas.

:func:`compare` does all four, using the same axis-role information the
extraction API exposes, so a mismatch is reported rather than guessed at.

    Arcs are matched by pin, related pin, timing type and timing sense;
    within such a group the ``when`` conditions are matched by logical
    equivalence, so ``"A & B"`` in one library matches ``"B & A"`` in the
    other. A condition that is only *implied* by the other describes a
    different arc, so those arcs are reported as existing in only one of the
    documents rather than compared. A library that leaves the ``timing_type``
    attribute out describes the same arc as one that writes ``combinational``,
    Liberty's default, and a library that leaves the ``timing_sense`` out
    describes the same arc as one that writes ``non_unate``.

    Two arcs of the same document that share their whole identity cannot be
    told apart. Such a collision is reported in
    :attr:`Comparison.duplicate_arcs` and neither of the two arcs is
    compared: picking one of them would compare values that do not
    correspond.

    A document that holds several cell groups with the same name is
    malformed: only the first group of a name can be addressed, so that
    group is the one that is compared. The repetition is reported in
    :attr:`Comparison.duplicate_cells` instead of being swallowed.

    The tables of matched arcs are matched by name, and their grids are aligned
    by *axis role* rather than by position: the load axis of one library is
    matched against the load axis of the other even when the two files store
    them in a different order. When the roles are unknown the axes are matched
    by position.

    When the roles are known on both sides but do not correspond — the load
    axis of one library against the transition axis of the other — there is
    nothing to align the grids on, and matching the axes by position would
    compare different quantities. Such a table is not diffed: it is reported
    in :attr:`Comparison.axis_role_mismatches` instead.

    By default only the points that exist in both grids are reported. With
    ``interpolate=True`` the second document is interpolated onto the first
    document's grid (or onto ``grid``), so that every point of the first grid
    gets a value. Points that exist in only one grid are always reported, with
    the missing side left as ``None``.

    A point that has no value in either document — a ``nan`` on both sides —
    is no difference: both documents agree that there is no data there, so it
    is not reported as unmatched.

    A table that depends on a unit the two documents declare differently — a
    time, a capacitive load, a voltage or a current — is not diffed: its
    numbers would measure different physical quantities. Such a table is
    reported in :attr:`Comparison.unit_mismatches` instead.

    A table whose values do not fill its grid is malformed: its values
    cannot be lined up with the points they belong to. None of them is
    compared, and the table is reported in
    :attr:`Comparison.malformed_tables` instead. A value that is not a
    number (``nan``, ``inf``) is no value at all: the point it belongs to
    is reported as missing rather than as a delta of ``nan``.

    Args:
        a: The first document (the one being validated).
        b: The second document (the reference).
        cells: Cell names to compare. Defaults to every cell of ``a``.
        cell: A single cell name to compare (a shorthand for ``cells=[cell]``).
        pin: Only compare arcs of this pin.
        table: Only compare tables with this name.
        interpolate: Interpolate ``b`` onto ``a``'s grid instead of comparing
            only the points the grids share.
        grid: The requested grid for ``interpolate=True``, as a mapping from
            an axis role (or ``"index_1"`` … ``"index_3"``) to the values to
            compare at. Defaults to the grid of ``a``.
        tolerance: Relative tolerance when matching axis values.

    Returns:
        A :class:`Comparison` with the compared points and the arcs and tables
        that exist in only one of the two documents.
