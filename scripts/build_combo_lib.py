"""Synthesize one big Liberty library by concatenating the *bodies* of several
ASAP7 ccsa/TT libs (all Vth flavors) under a single `library` group.

For each source file the leading comment block, the `library (...) {` opening
line, and the final `}` are dropped; everything in between is streamed out. Cell
names are unique across Vth (`_L`/`_R`/`_SL`/`_SRAM`), so there are no collisions.
Library-level attrs and template groups end up repeated once per file, which the
parser tolerates (last value wins; unknown template refs are harmless).

Optionally replicate the whole set ``--copies N`` times to inflate the file to a
size target; copies 2..N get a ``_cK`` suffix on every cell name to stay unique.

Usage:
    python scripts/build_combo_lib.py OUT.lib.gz LIBNAME [--copies N] IN1.gz IN2.gz ...
Env: GZ_LEVEL (gzip level, default 6).
