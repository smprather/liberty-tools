# Command Line Tools

`liberty-tools` installs two commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `liberty-view` | Serves a browser viewer for a Liberty library. |
| `liberty-format` | Reformats a Liberty file by brace depth, provably without changing its meaning. |

Both are installed with the package:

```bash
uv tool install "liberty-tools @ git+https://github.com/smprather/open-eda-file-tools.git"
```

The `liberty-tools` name on PyPI belongs to an unrelated project, and no
wheels are published for this one yet — install it from the repository.

In a checkout of the repository, run them through `uv run`:

```bash
uv run liberty-view dev.lib
uv run liberty-format dev.lib
```

Every command supports `--help` and `--version`:

```bash
liberty-view --help
liberty-format --version
```

## `liberty-view`

```text
Usage: liberty-view [OPTIONS] [LIBERTY_FILE]

  Browse a Liberty (.lib / .lib.gz) library in the browser.
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `LIBERTY_FILE` | `dev.lib` | The library to serve. `.lib` and `.lib.gz` are both accepted. The path is resolved relative to the working directory. |

### Options

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--host TEXT` | `127.0.0.1` | Address to bind the HTTP server to. Use `0.0.0.0` to listen on every interface. |
| `--port INTEGER` | `8000` | TCP port to listen on. |
| `--reload` | off | Reload the server when the source changes. Development only. |
| `--open-browser / --no-open-browser` | `--open-browser` | Open the viewer in the default browser once the server answers. |
| `--dev` | off | Add a *Dump Debug* button that writes the page state to `/tmp/liberty_view_debug.json`. |
| `--access-log / --no-access-log` | `--no-access-log` | Print the web server's per-request log. |
| `--exit-on-close / --no-exit-on-close` | `--exit-on-close` | Shut the server down shortly after the browser tab closes. |

### Behaviour

- The port is chosen by walking forward from `--port` until a free port is
  found (up to 64 ports). When the requested port is taken the viewer prints
  `port 8000 busy; using 8001` and uses the next one.
- The browser is opened only after the data API answers, not when the static
  shell is served, so the first page load never hits a half-started server.
- The server is cell-scoped: the browser fetches one cell at a time, so a
  multi-gigabyte library is opened without parsing all of it.
- `--dev` writes `/tmp/liberty_view_debug.json` when the *Dump Debug* button
  is pressed; it holds the page state (selected cell, table, axes) as JSON.
- The server reads three environment variables, which the command sets for
  you: `LIBERTY_FILE` (the library path), `LIBERTY_DEV` (set when `--dev` is
  given) and `LIBERTY_EXIT_ON_CLOSE` (set when `--exit-on-close` is given).

### Examples

```bash
# Serve dev.lib on the default port and open a browser.
liberty-view dev.lib

# Serve a gzipped library on a fixed port without opening a browser.
liberty-view --port 9000 --no-open-browser cells.lib.gz

# Serve on every interface, so another machine can reach it.
liberty-view --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 dev.lib

# Development: reload on source changes, print the access log.
liberty-view --reload --access-log dev.lib
```

## `liberty-format`

```text
Usage: liberty-format [OPTIONS] FILE

  Reindent a Liberty (.lib / .lib.gz) file by brace depth.
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `FILE` | The file to format. Must exist. `.lib` and `.lib.gz` are both accepted. |

### Options

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `-o, --output PATH` | stdout | Write the formatted text to this file. |
| `-i, --in-place` | off | Rewrite the input file. Not supported for `.gz` files. |
| `--check` | off | Do not write anything; exit non-zero when the file is not already formatted. |
| `--indent INTEGER` | `2` | Spaces per brace-nesting level. |

### Behaviour

- One indent level is applied per `{ }` nesting. Trailing whitespace is
  trimmed and runs of blank lines are collapsed to one.
- The result is **guaranteed functionally transparent**: the formatted text
  must lex to the exact same token stream as the input. If it does not, the
  file is left untouched and the command fails with
  `TransparencyError`. Comments and the contents of quoted strings are never
  touched.
- `--check` prints `already formatted` and exits 0, or `would reformat` and
  exits 1. Use it in CI to catch unformatted files.
- `--in-place` and `--output` are mutually exclusive in practice: `--in-place`
  wins if both are given. `--in-place` is rejected for `.gz` input — write
  the decompressed text with `-o` instead.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success (or "already formatted" with `--check`). |
| 1 | `--check` found a file that would be reformatted, `--in-place` was used on a `.gz`, or the result was not functionally transparent. |
| 2 | Usage error (the file does not exist, an unknown option, …). |

### Examples

```bash
# Print the formatted file to stdout.
liberty-format dev.lib

# Write a formatted copy.
liberty-format dev.lib -o dev.formatted.lib

# Reformat in place.
liberty-format --in-place dev.lib

# Fail the build when a file is not formatted.
liberty-format --check dev.lib
```

## The Viewer's HTTP API

While the viewer is running it serves a small JSON API. It is the same data
the page shows, and it is the easiest way to script a lookup against a large
library without loading it into Python.

| Route | Method | What it returns |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/meta` | GET | Library name, units, templates, attributes and cell count. |
| `/api/cells` | GET | Cell names. Query: `filter` (substring), `offset`, `limit` (≤ 5000). |
| `/api/cells/{cell}` | GET | The tree of pins, arcs, groups and tables of one cell. |
| `/api/cells/{cell}/source` | GET | The raw Liberty text of one cell (truncated at 1 MB). |
| `/api/table` | GET | One table's values and axes. Query: `cell`, `pin`, `group`, `arc_index`, `table`, `container`. |
| `/api/ping` | POST | `{"ok": true}`; keeps the exit-on-close watchdog alive. |
| `/api/bye` | POST | `{"ok": true}`; asks the server to shut down. |
| `/api/config` | GET | `{"dev": bool}` — whether `--dev` is on. |
| `/api/restart` | POST | Dev only: re-executes the server. |
| `/api/debug` | POST | Dev only: writes the page state to `/tmp/liberty_view_debug.json`. |

Errors are JSON: `404` for an unknown cell or table, `422` for a missing or
invalid query parameter, `500` for a missing library file.

The server binds `127.0.0.1` by default and has **no authentication** — anyone
who can reach the port can read the whole library.

```bash
liberty-view huge.lib --no-open-browser --port 8123 &
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8123/api/cells?filter=inv&limit=20"
```

---

## Typical Agent Workflow

```bash
# 1. Look at a library before touching it.
liberty-view library.lib --no-open-browser --port 8123 &

# 2. Check that a file is formatted before committing it.
liberty-format --check library.lib

# 3. Normalize the formatting of a file.
liberty-format --in-place library.lib
```

For programmatic work, use the Python API instead — see
[AI_API.md](AI_API.md) — and the [README](../README.md) for the quick tour.
