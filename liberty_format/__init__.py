"""Liberty source formatter — strict brace-depth indentation, guaranteed to be
functionally transparent (the formatted text lexes to the exact same token
stream as the input; otherwise the formatter refuses to emit).

The reindent is line-based: each line is re-indented to its brace nesting depth,
trailing whitespace is trimmed, and runs of blank lines are collapsed. Content
inside quoted strings and comments is never touched. Whether a change is
*functionally* safe is not trusted to this logic — it is proven afterward by
comparing the Rust lexer's token stream (see :func:`format_text`).
